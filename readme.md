# Summarizer

This repo contains data from my experiment with building a summarizer using the OpenAI 
`gpt-3.5-turbo` model. 

The experiment was performed using 20 articles from the EK knowledge base. One article was too large for the model's context window so that article was dropped from the final dataset, leaving 19 examples.

- `json` - contains JSON files processed by the summarizer
    - `20_EK_articles.json` - the original dataset of articles scraped from the EK knowledge base
    - `completions.json` - a JSON file containing completions generated by the summarizer
