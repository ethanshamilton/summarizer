However, choosing the right data catalog for a business depends on several criteria, including use cases, users, interoperability, governance, analytics and reporting, metadata management, and enterprise scale. Before selecting a vendor, businesses should consider their use cases and users to determine the most pertinent criteria for their data catalog."},"4":{"role":"assistant","content":"To turn a point solution into an enterprise-wide knowledge graph, organizations need a backlog of use cases, an enterprise ontology, and marketing and change management. Knowledge graphs can solve a wide range of problems, but early adopters typically start with a small, targeted solution. To expand the solution, organizations should create a backlog of use cases and a proper ontology that aligns with the larger business model. Marketing the solution is also important to ensure executives understand the value it adds to the business and to drive more funding for the knowledge graph."},"5":{"role":"assistant","content":"Keyword search and semantic search are two different methods of providing search to an enterprise application. Keyword search uses an inverted index to match exact terms in a query, while semantic search uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand the intent and meaning behind a query. Keyword search is easier to implement and interpret, while semantic search provides more comprehensive and relevant results. Keyword search is best for academic and legal search, while semantic search is best for chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer service applications. Cool features of keyword search include facets, phrase searching, and snippets, while semantic search offers concurrent multilingual capabilities, text-to-multimodal search, and content similarity search. The choice between the two methods depends on the specific needs of the organization."},"6":{"role":"assistant","content":"Enterprise Knowledge (EK) has identified that knowledge management (KM) solutions are not one-size-fits-all, and that each organization requires customized solutions that fit their content and technological needs. EK has identified that KM impacts different business groups differently, with knowledge creators contributing to and benefiting from improved KM processes the most. Knowledge creators are those middlemen and senior-level employees who have been with the organization for a good amount of time and\/or possess subject matter expertise. They generate the majority of knowledge and information within an organization, and are familiar with the processes and systems that best support the flow of knowledge."},"7":{"role":"assistant","content":"Enterprises should be cautious when implementing AI-based search solutions like ChatGPT, as they can return inaccurate information, are complex and expensive to implement, lack explainability, and may not be suitable for all users. While AI-based solutions have potential, their current implementations may lead to more problems than they solve. Organizations should consider the accuracy of the information returned, the complexity and expense of implementation, the lack of explainability, and the readiness of their users before embarking on an AI-based search solution. However, the capabilities of AI-based solutions around categorization and auto-summarization are promising and could be leveraged in tandem with traditional keyword search engines."},"8":{"role":"assistant","content":"Capturing and transferring explicit knowledge can be challenging for organizations due to issues such as lack of clear purpose statements for repositories, reliance on email inboxes, inconsistent tagging, and distributed knowledge.

While it may seem daunting to produce content for multiple channels, a thoughtful approach can turn this into a powerful opportunity for an organization's engineering team. Building a strong cross-functional team begins early in the planning phase, involving the entire development team in designing the architecture and selecting the technology stack for development. It is also crucial to break down the silos of a development team throughout both the planning and development processes of a large application. With the proper approach and correct mindset, a maintainable product can be delivered in the most efficient manner, while the development team involved with building the product will achieve growth and more opportunities to learn contemporary practices in the space of application development through hands-on practice."},"11":null,"12":{"role":"assistant","content":"The Great Resignation presents an opportunity for companies to attract new talent by embracing Agile values in their hiring process.
